# Strings
In this simple project I worked on strings with java to learn how to use them and the operations over them.
I worked on using single string and multiple ones, how to interact between two strings or multiple strings. 
I used the different methods with strings such as:indexOf, subString and others.
I also worked with storageResources to ease dealing with multiple strings and operating over them to get some piece of information.
